// Bolt-on accessories.
//
// Every part is a real mesh built by blender/build_parts.py to the dimensions
// of a named product (Front Runner Slimline II rack, Safari-style snorkel,
// Front Runner ladder, ARB sliders and awning, IPF light bar, Suzuki hard
// spare cover), shaped against a raycast sample of this car's body, and
// exported into model/parts.glb already positioned in the car frame. The page
// only clones the node it needs. An earlier version generated boxes in code
// and did not look like accessories at all.
//
// To change a part: edit build_parts.py, run it with Blender, then run
// `npx gltf-transform draco model/parts.glb model/parts.glb`.
